>> Introduction <<

- Lambda Functions in Python are anonymous [unnamed function] functions, implying they don't have a name.
- Lambda functions are limited to a single statement.

>> Syntax of Python Lambda Function <<

lambda arguments: expression

>> Need for Lambda Functions <<

1. Lambda functions reduce the number of lines of code
   when compared to normal python function defined using def keyword.

2. They are generally used when a function is needed temporarily for a short period of time,
   often to be used inside another function such as filter, map and reduce.

3. Using lambda function, you can define a function and call it immediately at the end of definition.
   This canâ€™t be done with def functions.
